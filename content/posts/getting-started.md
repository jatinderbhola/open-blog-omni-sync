# Getting Started with Next.js and Markdown

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes it easy to build fast, modern websites. In this post, we'll explore how to create a blog using Next.js and Markdown files.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several benefits for building blogs:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generate static HTML at build time for better performance
- **Dynamic Routes**: Create dynamic pages based on your content
- **API Routes**: Build serverless functions for additional functionality
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization and responsive images
- **Great Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, TypeScript support, and more

## Setting Up Your Blog

First, create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog --typescript --tailwind --app
cd my-blog
```

Then, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install gray-matter remark remark-html
```

## Working with Markdown

Here's an example of how to process Markdown files:

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';
import { remark } from 'remark';
import html from 'remark-html';

export async function getPostBySlug(slug: string) {
  const fullPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts', `${slug}.md`);
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);
  
  const processedContent = await remark()
    .use(html)
    .process(content);
  
  return {
    ...data,
    content: processedContent.toString(),
  };
}
```

## Styling Your Blog

We're using Tailwind CSS for styling. Here's an example of a styled blog post:

```jsx
export function BlogPost({ post }) {
  return (
    <article className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.content }} />
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have the basics set up, you can:

1. Add more features like tags and categories
2. Implement a search function
3. Add syntax highlighting for code blocks
4. Create an RSS feed
5. Add social sharing buttons

## Conclusion

Building a blog with Next.js and Markdown is a great way to create a fast, maintainable website. The combination of static site generation and dynamic features makes it perfect for content-focused sites.
